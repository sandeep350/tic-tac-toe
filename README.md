# Tic-Tac-Toe (C++ Console Game)

## Overview

This project is a simple console-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game written in **C++**. The player competes against a basic computer opponent that places its moves randomly.


## How to Play

* The game board consists of 9 spaces, numbered 1 through 9.
* Players take turns:

  * **You (Player X):** Choose your position by entering a number between 1 and 9.
  * **Computer (O):** Chooses a random available position automatically.
* First to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
* If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a tie.


## Features

* Simple text-based UI.
* Randomized computer moves.
* Game detects wins, losses, and ties.
* Input validation for player moves.

## Notes

* The computer uses a basic strategy (random moves). It does **not** use any advanced AI techniques.
* For reproducible computer behavior, you can replace `srand(time(0));` with a fixed seed.
